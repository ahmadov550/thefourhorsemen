                            <p> Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine a world without the Internet. On the Internet we can get a lot of useful information, learn about the latest news, and communicate with family and friends remotely. All these opportunities appear only because many websites and programs are created. But we all wondered how to create a simple website. Now we will try to tell you what you need to know and how to create a website.<br><br><h1>HTML:</h1><br>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.<br><br><h1>CSS:</h1><br> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.<br><br><h1>JS:</h1><br>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. Conclusion: To create this website we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned all the skills that we applied for our project on the CodeAcademy website. CodeAcademy is an American online interactive platform that offers free coding classes in 12 different programming languages including Swift, JavaScript, and etc. Also, CodeAcademy offers free markup languages such as HTML and CSS.<br><br><h1>Codecademy profiles:</h1><br><i><b>Gozal's profile:</b> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/GozalAlizada">https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/GozalAlizada</a></i><br><br><i><b>Nijat's profile:</b> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/ahmadov550">https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/ahmadov550</a></i><br><br><i><b>Suleyman's profile:</b> <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com/profiles/armbarmaker">https://www.codeacademy.com/profiles/armbarmaker</a></i><br><br><i><b>Latif's profile:</b> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Asgarov" target="_blank">https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Asgarov</a></i></p>
